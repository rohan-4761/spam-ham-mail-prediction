# Spam Mail Prediction with Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorizer

Welcome to the Spam Mail Prediction project! This Python notebook, inspired by Siddhardhan's "Complete Machine Learning Course in 60 Hours - Part 1," guides you through building a spam mail classifier using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction.

## Features:

- **Logistic Regression:** Leverage the power of Logistic Regression for effective spam classification.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Perform feature extraction on mail data using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method.

- **Inspiration:** Created based on the insights from Siddhardhan's comprehensive machine learning course on YouTube.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohan-4761/spam-ham-mail-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook and explore the project.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Project Structure:

- **Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb:** The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for the spam mail prediction project.

- **requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies required for the project.
